                I got my {" "}
                <span className="font-medium">Computer Science</span> degree in 2019, and ever since, 
                I've been riding the development wave with full gusto.  
                <span className="italic">What really lights my coding fire? </span> 
                The buzz of problem-solving.There's this awesome high when you crack the code to a challenging problem 
                â€” it's like finding the perfect piece to complete a puzzle.

                My core stack revolves around{" "}
                <span className="font-medium">
                Java, Spring Boot, and SQL
                </span>
                . I've also used TypeScript, C#, React, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Redis. 
                The dynamic nature of technology keeps me eager to explore and learn new tools and frameworks.

            <p>
                Outside the coding realm, I find joy in watching and playing football. Additionally,
                I have a keen interest in broadening my knowledge horizons and currently indulge in reading finance and self-help books.
